# Week2Team5
Week 2 Mini Project - Team 5

CLEANING DUTIES:
 - Column 'Date' : Check with Garima
 - Column 'Year' : Check with Garima
 - Column 'Type'
 - Column 'Country'
 - Column 'State'
 - Column 'Activity'
 - Column 'Injury' -- Injury: fatal 0, non-fatal 1, not specified -1? String would also work if uniformal (ofc) - Nicole (we can probably iterate here over the column
 - Column 'Time' : Check with Marco
 - Column 'Species' : Done
 A thought, can we also punt statistics that we learned during W2day3, grouping etc.? - Yey we should try to find correlation etc
#Notes - Nicole

 -df.fillna('not specified) - we could fill this across the whole dataframe
 -we need a no injury too
